<h1 align="center" id="title">Bookbot</h1>

<p id="description">This is my first project while learning Python based on the guided project from the boot.dev curriculum. The main difference between this project and the one in boot.dev is that I implemented a user input that allows the user to choose which book in the books/... path to analyse. This simple script parses a book in .txt format and lists the total number of words and the total number of most and least common letters.</p>
